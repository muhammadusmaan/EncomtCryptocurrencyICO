                                    En Comtâ€™s crypto-economic system is designed to promote a healthy, long
                                    term self-sustaining economy with participant<br />incentives aligned
                                    to the security and decentralization of the network. The main
                                    participants in this economy are<br />validation-clients. Their
                                    contributions to the network, state validation, and their requisite
                                    incentive mechanisms are<br />discussed below.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    The main channels of participant remittances are referred to as
                                    protocol-based rewards and transaction fees. Protocol-<br />based
                                    rewards are generated from inflationary issuances from a
                                    protocol-defined inflation schedule. These rewards will<br />constitute
                                    the total protocol-based reward delivered to validation clients, the
                                    remaining sourced from transaction fees. In<br />the early days of the
                                    network, it is likely that protocol-based rewards, deployed based on
                                    predefined issuance schedule, will<br />drive the majority of
                                    participant incentives to participate in the network.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    These protocol-based rewards are calculated per epoch and distributed
                                    across the active delegated stake and validator<br />set (per
                                    validator commission). As discussed further below, the per annum
                                    inflation rate is based on a pre-determined<br />disinflationary
                                    schedule. This provides the network with supply predictability which
                                    support<br />

                                    First, an overview of the inflation design is presented. This section
                                    starts with defining and clarifying
                                    <span style={{ color: "lightblue" }}>Terminology</span><br />commonly used
                                    subsequently in the discussion of inflation and the related
                                    components. Following that, we outline<br />En Comt's proposed
                                    <span style={{ color: "lightblue" }}>Inflation Schedule</span>, i.e. the
                                    specific parameters that uniquely parameterize the protocol-driven<br />inflationary
                                    issuance over time. Next is a brief section on
                                    <span style={{ color: "lightblue" }}>Adjusted Staking Yield</span>, and how
                                    token dilution might influence<br />staking behavior.

                                    followed by a discussion of
